An interactive web-based tool designed for training, teaching and demonstrating AC power factor concepts, admittance, reactive compensation, waveforms, and phasor behaviour in real time.

This tool is used during Rosa Engineering’s Electrical Fundamentals training courses and is published openly for educational use.

🔧 Overview

This application models a single-phase AC load with a variable resistive–inductive impedance, optional shunt capacitor, and real-time graphical displays. It is designed as a modern, intuitive training tool to help engineers, apprentices, and students understand:

Real, reactive, and apparent power

Voltage/current phasor relationships

Frequency-domain reactances

Instantaneous power

Power factor angle and correction requirements

The interface is built in React, features live interactive SVG graphics, and includes:

Waveform display (V, I, and instantaneous P)

AC power triangle

Phasor diagram

Full engineering metrics

Auto-calc of correction capacitor

Light/Dark mode
